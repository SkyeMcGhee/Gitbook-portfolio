# Cult of the Lamb

Notes:

\-story drives gameplay

\-mix of creepy and cute

\-lots of sound

\-lots of dialogue

\-management of cult and dungeon crawl style exploration

Cult of the Lamb's narrative, on the surface, has a simple set up and hook. However it's attention to detail and dedication to atmosphere makes its simple premise into something engaging and immersive.&#x20;

When the player first starts the game, they are immediately faced with a black screen and deep, distorted gibberish sounds. A prophecy is shown in white text as the gibberish plays, immedietly setting the goal and threat in one small paragraph.&#x20;
