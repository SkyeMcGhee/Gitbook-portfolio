# Cult of the Lamb



Cult of the Lamb's narrative, on the surface, has a simple setup and hook. However, its attention to detail and dedication to the atmosphere makes its simple premise engaging and immersive.&#x20;

When the player first starts the game, they are immediately faced with a black screen and deep, distorted gibberish sounds. In one small paragraph, a prophecy is shown in white text as the gibberish plays, immediately setting the goal and threat. This is a good example of the game's efficiency, accomplishing a lot in a small time frame. This is also true for introducing new gameplay mechanics, often done simply and directly through dialogue.

The story's main focus is the main character being bestowed the powers of a captured entity, escaping sacrifice, and beginning the prophecy that the player sees on the first screen. It is made clear from this point that the main character wasn't given this power without consequence, and that this entity will attempt to get it back when the time comes. This is further reinforced when the player meets the tutorial character, who was once in the same role.
