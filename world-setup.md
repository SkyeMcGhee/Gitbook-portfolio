# World Setup

## Chronicle Tenets

&#x20;■ Never kill the innocent

&#x20;■ Be your own, never submit&#x20;

■ Without a cause, you are nothing

## Setting

Gameplay will take place mainly in the city of Belfast, with room to involve Dublin or other major european cities. Vampre: The Masquerade relies heavily on large, densely populated cities for core mechanics to work- such as having a large enough population for vampires to feed on without getting caught, plenty of places to hide during daylight, and a high level of personal anonymity. There are no cities in Ireland that match that description. Spreading it out over multiple smaller cities should work

## Elysium

The hotel that the player manages is elysium. need to fill out background for how and why player is so politically involved and trusted by the prince (sire doing some manipulating?)
