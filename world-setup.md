# World Setup

## Chronicle Tenets

&#x20;■ Never kill the innocent

&#x20;■ Be your own, never submit&#x20;

■ Without a cause, you are nothing

## Setting

Gameplay will take place mainly in the city of Belfast, with room to involve Dublin or other major european cities. Vampre: The Masquerade relies heavily on large, densely populated cities for core mechanics to work- such as having a large enough population for vampires to feed on without getting caught, plenty of places to hide during daylight, and a high level of personal anonymity. There are no cities in Ireland that match that description. \
