# The Last Case Of Benedict Fox

\-mystery, puzzle solving

\-story-driven, focus on main character and relationships. distant father, dead mother, and an eldritch companion that almost seems to care for him

\-a detailed world with conflicting organizations post ww1 setting?

\-most of the game takes place in limbo, seemingly what's left of the mind of his dead father. It's easy to forget what the setting is in much of the gameplay, despite semi-often reminders. the platforming aspect is a bit distracting to the story.&#x20;
