# The Last Case Of Benedict Fox

\-mystery, puzzle solving

\-story-driven, focus on main character and relationships. distant father, dead mother, and an eldritch companion that almost seems to care for him

\-a detailed world with conflicting organizations post ww1 setting?

\-most of the game takes place in limbo, seemingly what's left of the minds of a dead family. It's easy to forget what the setting is in much of the gameplay, despite semi-often reminders. the platforming aspect is a bit distracting to the story. However the unique limbo's to each character is an interesting way to display the deseaced characters personality

\-puzzles are mainly used to unlock new areas, only occasionally for lore or items.

The Last Case of Benedict Fox is a strange mix of seperate puzzle and platforming mechanics, driven by a twisting mystery displayed through decaying minds and memories. The protagonist, Benedict Fox, explores these surreal places with the help of an eldritch companion.
