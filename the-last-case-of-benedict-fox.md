# The Last Case Of Benedict Fox

\-mystery, puzzle solving

\-story driven, focus on main character and relationships

\-detailed world with conlficting organisations, post ww1 setting?

\-most of the game takes place in limbo, seemingly whats left of the mind of his dead father. It's eas y to forget what the setting truly is in a lot of the gameplay
