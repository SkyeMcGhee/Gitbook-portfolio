\-most of the game takes place in limbo, seemingly what's left of the minds of a dead family. It's easy to forget what the setting is in much of the gameplay, despite semi-often reminders. the platforming aspect is a bit distracting to the story. However the unique limbo's to each character is an interesting way to display the deseaced characters personality

\-puzzles are mainly used to unlock new areas, only occasionally for lore or items.

\-each seperated limbo area is designed to reflect each characters past and personalities. the fathers is filled with books and papers, is straight foreward and mostly well lit with a warmer glow,. the mothers is cold, with dead and vicous plants and constant sliding downward slopes
