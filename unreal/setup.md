# Setup

Installing and getting my first project set up in unreal had some issues. My first attempting at making a new project kept failing to compile, giving a nondescript error and failing to open visual studios.\
\
First i double checked the engine and visual studios was up to date. After updating both the problem continued.&#x20;
