# The Last Case Of Benedict Fox: environmental storytelling



The Last Case of Benedict Fox is a strange mix of separate puzzle and platforming mechanics, driven by a twisting mystery displayed through decaying minds and memories. The protagonist, Benedict Fox, explores these surreal places with the help of an eldritch companion. The game environment plays a large role in the game's structure, simultaneously driving gameplay and story, as well as tying these two elements together.

The tutorial area is an exception to a lot of the design choices made further into the game, but still serves the same fundamental roles as any other area. After a brief cutscene laying out some key parts of the world, the player is immediately brought into action jumping across rooftops. Instead of the more vertical-based platforming that is seen in later sections, the player has nowhere to go but towards the right and only minor gaps to jump over. This area mainly exists to teach the player basic combat, and to act as a transition between two cutscenes and the main area of the game, and so has less detail and complexity compared to other areas. However, this sets up a basic understanding of the world and expectations for later scenes.

One of the best examples of the use of scenery to portray a character's past and personality is the first limbo that the player has access to.&#x20;
